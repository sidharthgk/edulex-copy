**Problem Alignment**

**Problem Statement:**  
The product aims to solve the lack of accessible, engaging, and effective digital learning tools specifically designed for dyslexic learners, particularly those who speak regional languages like Malayalam. Current solutions in the market do not offer a comprehensive, multisensory learning experience that integrates advanced technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Augmented Reality (AR) with proven teaching methods like the Orton-Gillingham approach. This gap leaves dyslexic students without adequate support to develop foundational reading and comprehension skills, hindering their educational progress and limiting their future opportunities.

**Target Audience:**

1. **Primary Users:**  
   * **Dyslexic Students (Aged 8-18):** Children and teenagers who struggle with reading, writing, and comprehension due to dyslexia, particularly those who speak regional languages or are multilingual.  
   * **Parents of Dyslexic Students:** Guardians who seek effective tools and resources to support their children's literacy development and academic success.  
   * **Educators and Teachers:** Special education professionals and mainstream teachers looking for digital resources to assist dyslexic students in their classrooms.  
2. **Secondary Users:**  
   * **Non-Dyslexic Students Improving Reading Skills:** Learners who may not have dyslexia but are looking for innovative ways to enhance their reading and comprehension abilities.  
   * **Adults Seeking Interview Preparation Tools:** Dyslexic adults or those with other learning disabilities who require specialized support for job preparation and interview skills.  
   * **Communities Supporting Learners:** Organizations, support groups, and communities focused on assisting learners with dyslexia and other learning challenges.  
   * **Special Education Professionals:** Experts in the field of special education who need specialized tools and content to cater to their students' diverse needs.

**Narrative:**

**Story 1: Aman, a 10-year-old dyslexic student**

Aman is a bright and curious 10-year-old student who loves learning, but struggles with reading and writing due to dyslexia. Despite his best efforts, Aman often feels frustrated and embarrassed when he can't keep up with his classmates. His parents and teachers have tried various methods to help him, but nothing seems to stick.

One day, Aman's teacher introduces him to our learning platform, which is specifically designed for dyslexic students. Aman is immediately drawn to the interactive and engaging interface, which makes learning feel like a game. He starts with a phonemic awareness exercise, where he has to identify and manipulate individual sounds within words. With the help of the platform's AI-powered adaptive technology, Aman is able to learn at his own pace and focus on areas where he needs the most improvement.

As Aman progresses through the platform, he begins to notice significant improvements in his reading and writing skills. He's able to sound out words more easily, and his handwriting becomes more legible. Aman's confidence grows, and he starts to enjoy reading and writing for the first time.

**Story 2: Trisha, a parent of a dyslexic child**

Trisha is a concerned parent who has been searching for effective ways to support her dyslexic child, Sakshi. Despite trying various tutoring programs and educational software, Trisha has yet to find a solution that truly understands Sakshi's unique needs.

When Trisha discovers our learning platform, she's impressed by its comprehensive and structured approach to teaching reading and writing skills. She's also reassured by the platform's ability to provide emotion oriented real-time feedback and assessment, which helps her track Sakshi's progress and identify areas where she needs extra support.

As Sakshi begins to use the platform, Trisha notices a significant reduction in her child's frustration and anxiety levels. Sakshi starts to enjoy learning, and her confidence grows as she sees improvements in her reading and writing skills. Trisha is grateful for the platform's ability to provide a supportive and inclusive learning environment, which has made a huge difference in Sakshi's educational journey.
